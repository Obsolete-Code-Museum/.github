# 🏛️ Obsolete Code Museum 🏛️

Welcome to the Obsolete Code Museum, where we celebrate all things outdated, deprecated, and just plain old-fashioned in the world of technology. Here, we don't believe in throwing out old code like yesterday's leftovers. Instead, we give it a loving home, and a place to be appreciated for its historical significance, its quirky quirks, and its sheer outdatedness.

## 🧰 What We Collect 🧰

We collect all kinds of obsolete code, from software that's no longer compatible with anything, to hardware that hasn't been seen since the '90s. Our collection includes:

- Abandoned open-source projects 🌱
- Obsolete programming languages 📜
- Deprecated APIs 🚫
- Outdated hardware drivers 💽
- Discontinued software applications 💻
- Legacy operating systems 🐍
- And much, much more! 🤖

## 🚀 Our Mission 🚀

Our mission is simple: to preserve the history of technology by collecting and archiving all kinds of obsolete code. We believe that old code shouldn't be forgotten or abandoned, but should be studied, appreciated, and celebrated for its contributions to the development of modern technology.

## 🤝 How to Contribute 🤝

Do you have some outdated code that you'd like to contribute to our collection? We'd love to hear from you! Whether it's an old project that you no longer use, or a forgotten gem from the early days of computing, we'll give it a loving home in our museum.

To contribute, simply move your repo to our organization.
